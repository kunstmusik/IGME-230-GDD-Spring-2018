## III. Discussion
1. For the portfolio mini project, you are going to utilize templates to create a web portfolio that showcases your work to potential employers. **Important:** If you are interested in being a *web designer*, at some point you will need to create a *custom* web site and forego CSS templates. Here is a valuable course you should check out on Lynda.com: [https://www.lynda.com/Behance-tutorials/Welcome/642472/704251-4.html](https://www.lynda.com/Behance-tutorials/Welcome/642472/704251-4.html)
1. Think about what you want the site to do for you. What is its *mission*? What is your dream job?
    - to get a specific co-op or job? ex. Game Designer, Game Developer, Combat Designer, Software Engineer, Web Developer, Mobile Developer, Creative Developer, Creative Technolgist, Simulations Developer ...
    - to work in a specific industry? AAA Game, Indie Game, Creative/Consulting/Marketing firm, Defense
    - or at a specific company? ex. Apple, Google, Microsoft, Sony - Barbarian Group, Odopod, Sapient Razorfish ...
    - or work for yourself (freelance)?
1. Craft a tagline or mission statement, just one or 2 sentences.
1. The portfolio is a *story*, everything you put on the site say something about you
    - **curate your projects** and focus one the ones that make you look qualified for your dream job:
      - show only the best work
      - show relevant work. Are you looking for a coding job? Then don't feature that sword you made in the 3D animation class!
      - show diverse work
      - think about the sequence - put the focus on your best work - showcase your best project
1. Curated Projects - show them in context:
    - with a web game or other interactive work, link to the actual application, don't just show screen shots
    - create YouTube demo videos for your games that are not published to the web
    - have supporting text that explains what the project does, and its inspiration
1. Show your development *process* - here are some ideas:
    - concept images from sketchbook
    - affinity maps/sticky notes
    - screenshots and notes on prototypes
    - pictures from user testing
1. Clearly identify what you did on the project:
    - be specific! 
    - don't exaggerate!

***We don't hire co-ops for Karmic balance, we hire co-ops because we have a job that needs to get done*** - AA Game Studio owner by AAA Game Company.

- Employers will look at your portfolio based on what their needs are, so make it easy for the recruiter to figure what you are good at!
